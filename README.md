  <h1>About Naruto Uzumaki: The Child of Prophecy</h1>

<p>In this project, I've decided to do my favorite anime character, which is <strong>Naruto Uzumaki</strong>. <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_%28series%29"> Naruto (1999) </a>
 is one of the first anime I've come across. It is also the reason why I started to work out to become a different person. When I was 12 years old, I started watching Naruto because it gave me excitement and motivated me to get good grades and workout during my free time.</p>


<blockquote>And my dream is to be the greatest Hokage! That way, people will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Someone important!</blockquote>

<p>Naruto Uzumaki</p>

<blockquote>It's almost unbearable, isn't it... the pain of being all alone. I know that feeling, I've been there, in that dark and lonely place, but now there are others, other people who mean a lot to me. I care more about them than I do myself, and I won't let anyone hurt them. That's why I'll never give up, I will stop you, even if I have to kill you! They saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness, they were the first to accept me as who I am. They're my friends.</blockquote>

<h1>Background Information</h1>


<h2>Childhood</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/CoolChange-Kakemono-Roll-up-Poster-Naruto/dp/B00XIAR3AO"> Naruto Uzumaki </a> is a fictional character who strives to one day to become the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village. When he was a baby, his parents Minato Uzumaki and Kushina died after the sudden attack on the Hidden Leaf Village. The village was attacked by the name of Madara Uchiha, later discovered to be Obito Uchiha. Orphaned, not having parents or anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village to afford daily necessities. Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to protect Naruto from his father's enemies. Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly resented Naruto for containing the wild beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hiruzen_Sarutobi"> Third Hokage </a> forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did. Afterward, he gained friends that included <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sakura_Haruno#Part%20I"> Sakura Haruno </a>, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha"> Sasuke Uchiha </a>, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake#Parts%20I-II"> Kakashi Hatake </a>, etc.</p>

<h2>Life as a Shinobi</h2>

<p>Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure. He became the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Jinch%C5%ABriki"> jinchuriki </a> of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth â€” a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgment all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as The Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_Shinobi_World_War"><strong><em>Fourth Shinobi World War</em></strong></a>, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.</p>

<h2>Adulthood</h2>

<p>As an adult, Naruto becomes wiser and more mature, though he retains some of his personalities when he was a kid. Although he finally achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, its many tasks not only overwhelm Naruto at times but often leave him unable to spend time with his family, particularly upsetting his son Boruto. He admits that part of this stems from not having grown up with a father himself, making it difficult for him to know how to interact properly with his children, mostly with his son. Naruto is also more responsible in his duties as Hokage and as a father; he forbids the use of the Kote in the <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ch%C5%ABnin_Exams"> Chunin Exams </a> as it diminishes a shinobi's true potential; he is disappointed by Boruto's cheating in the exams and even removes his forehead protector in front of the audience after lecturing him. Nevertheless, Naruto deeply loves his family, as he creates shadow clones to tend to them while he's busy, protects them in times of danger, spends time with them when he can, and expresses pride in his children's successes.</p>

<h1>Plans for Future Development</h1>

<p>In the future, I would like to talk about other characters in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/"> the anime (2002) </a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto_volumes"> manga of Naruto (1999) </a> because all the <em>characters</em> make up the story of how Naruto becomes the Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village. Also, in the future, I would try to add more historical background on the anime/manga itself throughout its serialization. In short, for the next project, I will plan to add more information for the <strong>subject</strong> in each specific topic that comes with it to further out my research abilities.</p>
